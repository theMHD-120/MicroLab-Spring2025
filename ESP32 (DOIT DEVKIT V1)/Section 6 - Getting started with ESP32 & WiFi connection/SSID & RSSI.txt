What is SSID?
SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is displayed when searching for a connection. For example, when you try to connect your phone or laptop to Wi-Fi, the names of the networks you see are the SSIDs.
In other words, SSID is the identifier or name that each Wi-Fi network chooses for itself.
-------------------------------------------------------
What is Signal Strength (RSSI)?
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)** shows the strength of the Wi-Fi signal received from each network.
>>> This number is usually displayed as a negative number; the closer this number is to zero, the stronger the signal.
>>> For example: RSSI of -30 dB means a very strong signal, and RSSI of -90 means a very weak signal.
-------------------------------------------------------
So in our code when we scan for networks:
1) We print each network name (SSID) and
2) The signal strength of that network (RSSI)
to the serial monitor so we can see what networks are around and which one is stronger.
