What is SSID?
SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is displayed when searching for a connection. 
For example, when you try to connect your phone or laptop to Wi-Fi, the names of the networks you see are the SSIDs.
In other words, SSID is the identifier or name that each Wi-Fi network chooses for itself.

What is Signal Strength (RSSI)?
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) shows the strength of the Wi-Fi signal received from each network.
>>> This number is usually displayed as a negative number; the closer this number is to zero, the stronger the signal.
>>> For example: RSSI of -30 dB (closer to 0) means a very strong signal, and RSSI of -90 means a very weak signal.
-------------------------------------------------------
So in our code, when we scan for networks, we print the following:
1) The name of each network (SSID)
2) The signal strength of that network (RSSI)
So we can see what networks are around and which one is stronger.
